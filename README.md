# Linear CLI

High-performance CLI for Linear.app with JSON output, smart ID resolution, and optimized GraphQL queries. Designed for LLM agents and users who prefer structured data over web interfaces.

## Key Entry Points

- **src/main.ts** - CLI entry point with Commander.js setup and command routing
- **package.json** - Project configuration with pnpm package manager (Node.js >= 22.0.0)
- **src/utils/linear-service.ts** - Core Linear API service with smart ID resolution and performance optimizations

## Quick Build Commands

```bash
# Install and run
pnpm install
pnpm start issues list -l 10

# Authentication (choose one)
linear --api-token <token> issues list
LINEAR_API_TOKEN=<token> linear issues list
echo "<token>" > ~/.linear_api_token && linear issues list
```

## Core Commands

```bash
# Issues: list, search, create, read, update
linear issues list -l 25
linear issues search "bug" --team ZCO --project "Mobile App"
linear issues create --title "Fix bug" --team ZCO --labels "Bug,High Priority"
linear issues read ZCO-123
linear issues update ZCO-123 --state "In Progress" --priority 1

# Projects: list, read
linear projects list
linear projects read "Mobile App"
```
