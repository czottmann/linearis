This project uses the MIT-licensed `LinearService` class, taken wholesale from
[github.com/tacticlaunch/mcp-linear](https://github.com/tacticlaunch/mcp-linear/blob/fdfb7fdd26e9b42182d0768be1d441accd4c9e01/src/services/linear-service.ts) â€“ thank
you very much for your generosity!

It uses [Commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) for creating its CLI.
Also many thanks for a solid piece of software engineering!
